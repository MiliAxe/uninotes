A useful algorithm to compress data without losing data (lossless compression).
The process usually involves a **full binary tree** to decode the data.

**NOTE:** Every fully binary tree has n - 1 internal leaves where n is the count of leaves.
## Prefix codes
No code is the prefix of another code. This is vital for the operation of the decoding.
