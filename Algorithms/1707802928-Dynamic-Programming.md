# Dynamic Programming

Recursion works well when we don't have duplicate calculations.
Dynamic programming works well when we have a bunch of duplicate calculations.
Usually, 1D, 2D and 3D and ... arrays are needed to store the result of the calculations.
We can consider the solutions to be bottom-up.
It's key to look to break down the problem to smaller sub-problems. 


3 ways of solving problems.

1. Recursion
2. Dynamic Programming (for problems that have duplicate sub problems) (from bottom-up)
3. Very complex that are not solved with the two above.

Some Problems related to DP:

## Cut and paste principal
This technique says that in order to have an optimal solution, we should have used optimal underlying problems.
