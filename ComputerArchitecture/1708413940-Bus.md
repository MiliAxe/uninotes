If too many [[1707808591-Register|Registers]] exist, we can use bus lines to share the pathway of data movement between [[1707808591-Register|Registers]]. But of course, we have to handle the lines and make sure data is not corrupted.

## Handling the data output
In order to make sure that the correct register puts the data on the bus lines, we can use multiplexers to to only choose one input as output.

**Alternative approach:** We can also use three-way buffers instead of multiplexers:

## Handling the data input
In order to make sure that the correct register receives the data we want. We can use decoders here to make sure only one registers receives the data.

## Handling multiple registers
A bus may be used to send data from different registers to each other.
