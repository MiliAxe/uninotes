[[EER Model]] is an enhanced version of the [[1708270814-ERD-Model|ERD-Model]]. It has some extra features like sub-classes.

## Sub-classes and super-classes
Just like the concept of OOP, sub-classes can be made out of entities so that we can have a cleaner design. The class who inherits is called a subclass. The class which is inherited from is called a super-class.

### Specialization
When an entity starts having its own special abilities, we can inherit other entities from that and specialize entities.

### Generalization
This is quite the opposite and we can sum all the common attributes in one entity. This can be applied to the same image as above.
