# Data models

A collection of data + its needed operations.

- In data models use cases play a vital role. meaning that the users and their operations are considered.

## Conceptual level

In this level we are not concerned about the details of implementation, and we are more concerned about the concepts
that are going to be implemented. User needs, ways of making revenue and so on are considered here. Usually, people who
are not involved in the technology aroe better able to give ideas in this level.

It is built around the [[1708270814-ERD-Model|ERD Model]]
## Physical level

Things like memory management, how databases work and all the geeky things behind the scenes are implemented here.
This is basically all the low-level things that engineer is concerned with.

Keynotes:

- Paging
- Blocking
  they play a vital role in data retrieval.

Indexing plays a vital role here

## Representational layer:

Something in between of Conceptual and Physical level that connects the two and relates the two to each other.
