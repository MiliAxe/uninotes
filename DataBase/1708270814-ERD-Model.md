### Attributes
Different kinds of attributes:
- Atomic: cannot be split into smaller part. e.g.: age
- Composite: Can be split into several parts. e.g.: Address can be split like: city, state and so on
- Single valued: can only have one value: e.g.: age
- Multi-valued: Can have multiple values: e.g.: hobbies
- Stored: The value is stored instead of calculated: e.g.: date of birth
- Derived: the attribute is calculated from an attribute: e.g.: age calculated from date of birth
