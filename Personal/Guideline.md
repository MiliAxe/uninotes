So overall in order to have a life that is fulfilling for me, I have to have the following in mind:

## Health
Body should be taken care of. This means:
### Lifestyle
I should follow a routine everyday. It is super important to know what I will be doing everyday. This means that when I wake up, I should have a plan for the day laid out. This prevents me from wandering around everyday.
### Sleep
I need to have minimum of 7 hours of sleep every night. This means that if I want to stick to a good morning routine, I have to make sure to hit the bed early. Some nights I might have to sleep late because of family or friends events but this does not mean I should change my sleep routine.
### Nutrition
Since I am working out, I should be taking what I eat everyday seriously. Enough protein to maintain and increase muscle mass and don't eat junk food regularly.
