A type of [[1708263542-finite-automata|finite automata]] that is *deterministic* meaning that given a state and an input symbol, there is exactly one next state.
# Transition Graphs
a graph that shows the evolution of their state and how it reacts to the different flow of data.

Here, we start from the left and go on until we reach the final state.

If we go on the string according to the graph, we will reach the final state.

We will reach the final state **ACCEPT** when we:
- Have used all the chars of the string
- We are in the final state

If none of the above we will be in **REJECT** state.

# Mathematical representation
$$M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta , q_{0}, F)$$
Here, $Q$ is our state, $\Sigma$ is the inputs we accept, $\delta$ is the transition function, $q_0$ is our iniital state and $F$ is our final states

Let's find the parameters for this one:

We can also show the $\delta$ as a table here:

### Extended transition function

The transition function in its extended form, accepts multiple inputs as its function input:

For example:
![[Pasted image 20240218191507 1.png]]

Here we have given the function $\delta^*$ multiple inputs $ab$.
# [[1708268391-language|language]] accepted by DFA
![[Pasted image 20240217110026.png]]
Here, the L(M) is accepted because all of the members lead to a final state

![[Pasted image 20240217110521.png|center]]
Here, we mean that we reach the final state after some movement.

we might have to design the DFA for some examples.

**A very nice approach when creating the diagram is to make sure every node has all the outputs**

## [[1708326485-NFA|NFA]] to DFA conversion
We will show this with an example since it will become easier to understand.

### Specifying initial states
In order to specify initial states, we should identify the starting state $q_0$ and specify all the destinations we can get to there using $\lambda$ transitions:

In this example, we have the starting position $q_0$ and there is no starting positions for it, therefore, we only have the $\{q_0\}$ as our DFA starting position.

### Translating transitions
After this, we should translate the transitions from the [[1708326485-NFA|NFA]] to the DFA. In order to this, we identify the states we can go to from each state to another using an alphabet. Pay attention that due to the existence of [[1708889306-Lambda-transition|lambda transitions]] we can end up in multiple states with one character.

### Specifying final states
if any of the states in the set of each state is a final state, then the state in the DFA is also a final state.

## Minimization
It is beneficial to minimize our [[1708263536-DFA|DFA]] to reduce the number of similar transitions. 
It can help reduce the complexity of our [[1708263536-DFA|DFA]] diagram.

### Removing unreachable states
Before anything, we should remove the unreachable states, the states that we can't reach them anyhow. These serve no purpose since there is no way to reach that state.

### Using the equivalence theorem
The method mentioned in the slides is the [[Equivalent states]] method.
We start off with the [[Equivalent states#^b62408|0th equivalents]] and we keep finding the higher kth-order equivalents until they don't change. From there, we have the states that we want to use in our minimized [[1708263536-DFA|DFA]].
