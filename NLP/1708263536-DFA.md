# Transition Graphs
a graph that shows the evolution of their state and how it reacts to the different flow of data.

Here, we start from the left and go on until we reach the final state.

If we go on the string according to the graph, we will reach the final state.

We will reach the final state **ACCEPT** when we:
- Have used all the chars of the string
- We are in the final state

If none of the above we will be in **REJECT** state.

# Mathematical representation
$$M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta , q_{0}, F)$$
Here, $Q$ is our state, $\Sigma$ is the inputs we accept, $\delta$ is the transition function, $q_0$ is our iniital state and $F$ is our final states

Let's find the parameters for this one:

We can also show the $\delta$ as a table here:

# Languages accepted by DFA
![[Pasted image 20240217110026.png]]
Here, the L(M) is accepted because all of the members lead to a final state

![[Pasted image 20240217110521.png|center]]
Here, we mean that we reach the final state after some movement.

we might have to design the DFA for some examples.

**A very nice approach when creating the diagram is to make sure every node has all the outputs**
