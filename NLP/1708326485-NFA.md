# Definition
Just like [[1708263536-DFA|DFA]] but with one input, we can go to multiple states (it is not deterministic). Here we can have the input $a$ but have multiple paths to go.

Unlike [[1708263536-DFA|DFA]] we don't necessarily have to have an output in each node for all the alphabets. Here, if we were in [[1708263536-DFA|DFA]], we had to have $b$ as output in $q_0$ as well.

# Formal Definition
This is how formally [[1708326485-NFA|NFA]] is defined:
$$M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$$
$Q$ is the set our states

## Acceptance condition
a [[1707911450-Strings|string]] is accepted if:
- We have consumed all of the characters
- We have reached the final state
- There is a path in which we can reach the final state.

## Compared to [[1708263536-DFA|DFA]]
If [[1708263536-DFA|DFA]] can solve a problem, [[1708326485-NFA|NFA]] can solve it as well. But [[1708326485-NFA|NFA]] is more high level and easier for human mind.
