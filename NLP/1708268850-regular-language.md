A [[1708268391-language|language]] is regular if there is a [[1708263536-DFA|DFA]] for it.

**In order to prove a [[1708268391-language|language]] is regular we have to show a [[1708263536-DFA|DFA]] exists for it**

## Properties
If we have the regular language $L_1$ and $L_2$, they are closed under **Union, Concatenation, and star.**

### Union

The [[1708889306-Lambda-transition|Lambda transition]] enables us to have both of these ways

### Concatenation

Again, we can easily line them up like so using [[1708889306-Lambda-transition|lambda transitions]].
