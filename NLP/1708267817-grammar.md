**Definition:** a set of rules for the structure of the sentences in a [[1708268391-language|1708268391-language]]

for example, the English language might enforce such a grammar:

## Terminology
In grammars, such a notation is usually used to indicate the structure of the rules:
$$ <noun> \rightarrow  boy$$

 Another notation can be using the following:![[Pasted image 20240218181252 1.png]]

The $V$ parameter is the left hand side variables, the $T$ parameter are the small characters we have (the terminals) the $P$ variable is the possible production routes.

**Sentential form:** in examples, we might have some forms of a sentence that has both a variable and a terminal in it this is called a sentential form:

In every step, we are replacing $S$ with $aSb$ so we have a recursive-like action here. So, we might have to take several steps to get a sentence from the beginning that's why we also have the following notation:

$$ S \Rightarrow^* aaabbb $$
Which means we *have taken several steps* to get there.
