# **Strings** : A consecutive sequence of letters

e.g.:
- "cat"
- "doggo"

## Operations

- Strings may contain operations like **concatenation** and adding to each other
adding to strings to each other will make its length be the sum of two.

- **$\lambda$** is basically an empty string.

- The **power operation** concatenates the string with self n times.

- The **$\Sigma^*$** operation is all the possible strings from the chars in a set like A = {a, b}.

- The **$\Sigma^+$** operation is basically the **$\Sigma^*$** operation without the lambda char.
- The **Reverse** operation reverses the string: ^d229a3
