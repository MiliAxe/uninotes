# Introduction

## Computation

CPU works with close relationship with the memory.

## **Strings** : A consecutive sequence of letters

e.g.: "cat", "doggo"

### Operations

Strings may contain operation like operations like concatenation and adding to each other
adding to strings to each other will make its length be the sum of two.
Lambda is basically an empty string.
The power operation concatenates the string with self n times.
The \* operation is all the possible strings from the chars in a set like A = {a, b}.
The + operation is basically the \* operation without the lambda char.
