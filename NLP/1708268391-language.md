**Definition:** a set of [[1707911450-Strings|Strings]] 

Basically, it is any subset of [[1707911450-Strings#^3f5777|Sigma *]]

**Example:**
If our alphabets are:
$$\Sigma = \{a, b\}$$
$$\Sigma^* = \{\lambda, a, b, aa, ab, bb, ba, \dots\}$$
Then languages are defined as subsets of the set above.

## Operations:
Since language is just a set, we can have the usual set operations on it. 
We can also have the complement operator on it which is also a usual set operation.
A [[1707911450-Strings#^d229a3|reverse]] operation reverses all the [[1707911450-Strings|Strings]] inside the set.
[[1707911450-Strings#^5bd83f|Concatenation]] is also a very usual one-to-one operation on the members of the set.

### Closures
The start-closure and positive-closure operation is as follows:
$$L^* = L^0 \cup L^1 \cup L^2 \dots$$
$$L^+ = L^1  \cup L^2 \dots$$
