## Mechanical
These sensors are related to mechanical types of stimuli:
### Motion sensor
Used for measuring the movement of all kinds:
#### Accelerometer
For measuring acceleration:
- Crash, impact detection
- Vibration, tilt, roll
- airbags
- motion detection 
#### Gyroscope
Rotational movement around X, Y and Z axis.
Good for measuring how rolled we are around X, Y and Z.
- Image stabilization
- GPS
- VR headset
- Cars stabilization
#### Resolver
Angular position of a thing that rotates
- Can be used to find how much a shaft has rotated
- useful in servo and robots
#### Tachometer
Used to measure how fast a thing is spinning (RPM in motors)
- Car engine rpm
- Abnormal rotation
- blade rotation
#### Optical/Inductive sensor
Measure how much and how fast of the angular displacement 
#### LVDT
Measuring linear displacement of parts
- Suspension setting
- aircraft actuator
#### Potentiometer
Displacement of linear, rotationary
- Used in knobs usually
### Force sensing
#### Strain gauge
measuring force via changing resistance. cheap
#### Piezoelectric force sensing
measuring force via outputting electricity

## Chemical
- Usually done by sampling the substance and reaction on them
- useful for hazardous materials
- may be indirect and direct based on the substance and usage
### Gas sensors
basically the only thing mentioned in the slides.
- Alcohol breath
- Fire detection
## Biosensor
Detect biological substance
- Glucose
- Cholesterol
- DNA
## Environmental
### Temperature
#### Thermocouple
big range, good for industrial, jet engines. fast response. bad accuracy
#### RTD
Good range, high accuracy, slow. good for scientific locations
#### Thermistor
Used in home appliances, medical applications. sensitive and fragile
#### IR
Fast response, medium accuracy. fast response
## Optical
